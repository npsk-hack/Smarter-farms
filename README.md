#### NPS Indiranagar
Our system monitors the water level in the soil and also takes in data about the crop, its variety, the watering pattern for that particular crop and waters the plant accordingly using a water pump. It is solar powered and therefore it also contributes to a greener planet. From the farmers' perspective this system helps save money and effort too. It also increases the yield of the crop by providing adequate amounts of water at appropriate intervals thus making their lives easier and more fruitful.
